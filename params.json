{"name":"Authenticator","tagline":"Two-Factor Authentication Client for iOS","body":"[<img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/gh/mattrubin%2Fauthenticator@2x.png\" alt=\"GitHub version\" height=\"18px\">](http://badge.fury.io/gh/mattrubin%2Fauthenticator)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattrubin/authenticator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattrubin/authenticator)\r\n\r\nThis app generates and displays one-time passwords for logging into systems which use two-factor authentication, or any other system which supports [counter-based](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) or [time-based](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) OTPs. The goal of this project is to create a free, simple, open-source alternative to Google Authenticator. This project was based on the neglected open-source [Google Authenticator](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/) client for iOS, and has been rewritten to create a clean code-base using modern APIs.\r\n\r\nOTP secret keys can be entered into the app manually, via an iOS cross-app URL scheme, or by scanning a QR code with the in-app QR reader. The [format for key URIs](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/wiki/KeyUriFormat) is supported by many OTP apps and is often presented to the user as a QR code when they are activating two-factor authentication for an online account.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
